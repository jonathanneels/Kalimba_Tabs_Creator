To-do (feedback admin@kalimbatabs.net):

*play function
- change ms to bpm (tempo)
- stop/pause button
- volume button

*sheet
- able play all notes inside a parenthesis
- able to start playing from selected note (row)
- auto scroll (follows the notes in the screen while playing)

*floating menu(add row button + note header) -helpful if the tab is long, so user won't scroll up to click a button.

*add row button(before/after)
-able to add a row "before or after" a currently selected row.
